Here we were supposed to create a website promoting a Bank made for developers. The main focus for this was the use of flexing and columns and to make it responsive. There are some hover effects on the buttons. The navbar also included some Javascript that was fun to see how it can manipulate your website.

Unfortunatly I couldn't get my Loom to work so I had to use an alternative screen recorder such as Tella.
